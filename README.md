# 2048_by_c

A early trying on C and programming.

The very first project I finished beyond "hello world".
It's course practice in my first year at college, which is in the beginning of 2018.
And there is a timestamp in my source code.
Even earlier than I create my GitHub Account.

It's a 2048 made by C with function programming.
