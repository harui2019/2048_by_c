# 2048_by_c

An early trying on C and programming.

The very first project I finished beyond "hello world".
It's course practice in my first year at college, which is in the beginning of 2018.
And there is a timestamp in my source code.
Even earlier than I create my GitHub Account.

It's a 2048 made by C with function programming.

If you want to do some practice on programming, this might can help you to make the first step beyond "hello world".

Also, you shoild prepare some C complier in your computer. I made this with Visual Studio (not VSCode) on Windows 10 Laptop.
For macOS or Linux, you can consider other complier like gcc or something else.
It should be no difference among these compliers.
